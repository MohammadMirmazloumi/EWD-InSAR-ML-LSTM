# Early Warning Detection of Natural Hazards using InSAR datasets and Machine/Deep Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a machine/deep learning-based early warning detection system for ground instabilities, with a focus on mining site case studies. The system integrates InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) time series data and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model or Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and Random Forest (RF) models to predict ground movements and support early alarm systems.

By providing high spatial and temporal resolution ground motion data, this tool aims to help experts monitor vulnerable areas and activate vital precautions in advance of potential natural or man-made ground instabilities.

Overview

Early alarm systems play a crucial role in safeguarding lives and mitigating economic loss from natural hazards or human activities such as mining. This repository presents a machine learning model tailored to integrate InSAR time series data for ground instability prediction. The system forecasts ground movements and enables early detection of potential collapses by analyzing spatial and temporal trends.

Three forecast ranges are considered in this tool (3, 4, and 5 multistep predictions), and adjacent time series are used to minimize false positives in ground instability detection. The proposed tool is designed for mining site case studies, but it can be adapted for various types of infrastructures and geographic areas.
Key Features

- LSTM-based prediction model for multistep ground movement forecasts.
- Uses InSAR time series data for high-resolution spatial and temporal ground motion analysis.
- Capable of forecasting potential ground collapses in vulnerable areas such as mining sites.
- Designed to be interpreted by experts to activate reliable alarms and mitigate the consequences of potential ground failures.
- Case studies from Spain, Brazil, and Australia showcase the tool's effectiveness in identifying unstable regions before collapse.

Methodology

This study integrates InSAR ground motion data with an LSTM neural network to predict ground movements in critical mining areas. The tool works by analyzing InSAR time series data over vulnerable regions and generating early warnings based on multistep forecasting of potential ground movements. Adjacent time series are also considered to reduce false positives and ensure the accuracy of the predictions.

Key steps:

- Data Collection: InSAR data is collected for each study area.
- Data Preprocessing: Time series data is transformed to fit the model.
- Model Training: The LSTM model is trained on historical InSAR data to predict future ground movements.
- Prediction and Evaluation: Multistep predictions are generated, and the results are analyzed to identify regions with potential instability.
